    "The dataset consists of features that describe characteristics of the cell\n",
    "nuclei present in a digitised image, these features are defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Radius:** the average distance from the center of the nucleus to each of the boundary points<br>\n",
    "2. **Texture:** the standard deviation of the gray-scale values, the gray-scale value represents the intensity of the shades of gray in each pixel of the image<br>\n",
    "3. **Perimeter:** the total distance of the boundary of the cell nucleus<br>\n",
    "4. **Area:** the number of pixels on the interior of the boundary and adding one-half of the pixels on the perimeter, to correct for the error caused by digitisation<br>\n",
    "5. **Smoothness:** the difference between the length of a radius length and the mean length of the two radius lines surrounding it, hence the local variation in radius lengths<br>\n",
    "6. **Compactness:** the perimeter and area are combined to obtain a measure of compactness of the cell nuclei<br>\n",
    "7. **Concavity:** the severity of concave portions of the contour, a high concavity means that the boundary of the cell nucleus has indentations, and thus is rather rough than smooth<br>\n",
    "8. **Concave points:** the number of concave portions of the contour of the cell nucleus<br>\n",
    "9. **Symmetry:** the symmetry is determined by first finding the longest line from boundary point to boundary point through the center of the nucleus, subsequently the relative length differences between the lines perpendicular to the longest line to the boundary in both directions are measured, attention should be given to nuclei where the longest line cuts through the boundary because of concavity<br>\n",
    "10. **Fractal dimension:** the fractal dimension is approximated by the \"coastline approximation\", the perimeter of the nucleus can be measured using different lengths of measuring sticks, as this length increases, the total length of the measured \"coastline\" decreases due to lower precision of the measurement, the theoretical fractal dimension is then determined by dividing the logarithm of the observed perimeter L(s) by the logarithm of the measuring stick length s, plotting log(L(s)) against log(s) and determining the negative value of the slope results in an approximation of the fractal dimension D, finally, the desired feature is determined by the calculation D - 1."
