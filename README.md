# Neural Network to Classifying Breast Cancer Wisconsin

Classifying Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset From UCI Machine Learning Repository Using Neural Network

This repository classifies Breast Cancer Wisconsin [Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29) from UCI Machine Learning Repository using neural network model with multiple hidden layers, the inputs to the neural network model are the feature values computed from digitised image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA), and the outputs from the model are the two identified classification diagnosis classes B or M

# Problem Statement

Given a list of features (vectors) calculated from a digitised image of FNA of a breast mass from a patient. The problem is how to diagnose (determine) whether or not the patient has breast cancer. It is considered as a 2-class classification problem (B = Benign, M = Malignant)
